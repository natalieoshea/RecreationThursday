# RecreationThursday

\#RecreationThursday is a social project for data visualization folks to recreate and remix existing art pieces through any medium of their choosing - through code, painting, music, embroidery, whatever! Our goal is to get creativity flowing and most importantly to have fun!

New pieces will be posted every two weeks on twitter under the [#RecreationThursday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/RecreationThursday) hashtag, with a different curator each time! We encourage you to share your recreations over the following two weeks using the same hash tag.

Each art piece will be accompanied with [alt-text](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/picture-descriptions) to make this project as accessible as possible. We ask you to please include alt text with your recreations - feel free to use the alt-text we have provided as a starting point and update to capture your recreation as you see fit!

# Want to Contribute?
If you are interested in being a curator for #RecreationThursday please file an [issue](https://github.com/sharlagelfand/RecreationThursday/issues) on our github repo! Include the following:

1. The artist name, piece name, and link to the art piece.
2. Your name and a link to your twitter account/preferred media platform. 
3. A draft of the alt text. FYI: Writing alt text for art can be hard, so our community of organizers will provide suggestions if needed, to help you!

We will then provide you with available dates for curating! On that date, you should announce that you are the curator, share the piece, and link to the repo. Here are examples from [Maya's curation](https://twitter.com/Mayacelium/status/1405503706653597698) and [Natalie's curation](https://twitter.com/_natalie_oshea/status/1400526683170541570). If you want to provide suggestions, but not actually be the one who posts, please let us know. We will post for you!
